# EA Desktop (ead) integration for GOG Galaxy

Allows to import your list of games, achievements and time played.

Forked from FriendsOfGalaxy.

## Disclaimer

Please note that, in order to make this plugin fully functional, you need to have a valid EA Desktop account.
As the data vary from the Juno API to the now almost defunct Origin API, some features might be tinkered on further releases to make them work as intended.

## Installation

*MAKE SURE GOG GALAXY IS CLOSED BEFORE PROCEEDING TO THE INSTALLATION.*

1. Download the plugin from the [releases page](https://github.com/BellezaEmporium/galaxy-integration-ead/releases).
2. Unzip the archive.
3. On the folder, use the "install.bat" file to automate the process.
4. Start GOG Galaxy

## Configuration

1) First time ? Login to your EA Desktop from GOG Galaxy, and enjoy your games. The offer cache file will be created into your temp folder.
2) Once the first part is done, disconnect and reconnect. It should be now detecting your local games, and letting you install/play them.

I know, this is not optimal, but this is (for now) the only possible way I've found to make this work.
